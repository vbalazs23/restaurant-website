# restaurant-website
### [See it hosted here](https://pizza-restaurant-website.onrender.com)
### About this project:
- This is a slightly modified version of an actual website that I coded for a local restaurant. There was no design specified by the owner so 
I had to "come up with something cool".<br>
- I got inspired by a street food restaurant's [website](https://artsdistrictkitchen.com/) located in Las Vegas (my demo site posted here even uses some pictures from that site).
The original website is built with WordPress and features pictures sliding up and down as the user scrolls.<br>
- I really wanted to implement that feature and also to make it a one page website. <br>
- This was from a time when even my morning espresso contained some Bootstrap... sooo looking back let's just say it would have been much easier without it 
(especially to make the site look good on every screen sizes)
as it's a very very custom design. 
- I built this one with Node.js and Express as I wanted to use some useful packages and there were plans to add in an online order system later...
- ...but sadly the owner decided to close the restaurant shortly after opening it so the site never went live. 
### Main features of the site: 
-  Using intersection observers to track where the user's viewport on the site in order for the navbar to work
-  Templating with ejs
-  Custom tab system for the menu section
-  Using a customised Mapbox map to display the location of the restaurant
-  Lazy loading and animations implemented <br><br><br>
PS. the site is in Hungarian.
